My portions are quite normal, I often leave behind some food on the plate, because I pick more food than I can really eat. I'm often starving because of the lack of food, I'm embarassed of eating front of people.   \nI tryed to count out the calories I eat, it really helped me a lot. I actually gained back a little bit of weight, bit I'm still losed 11 lbs this way (5 kg). I try to eat more times a day with smaller portions, so I don't get hungry throught the day, and I try to eat healthier snacks than before. I hope I can lose more weight, my goal is to reach my healthy weight which would be around 120 lbs (55 kg)."}]}

We would spend his free time talking about astrophysics and recent documentaries. Every now and then he would ask me about something he had just absorbed and want to explain to me in detail. I just tried to keep up and ask him questions that kept him thinking about what his new information meant in context and what in the big picture of the universe or life or gaming or social interaction.\n\nUnfortunately the kid had no ability to emotionally regulate, because that's just how the condition hits some people. Loud noise and unclear rules could send him into a hella rage. There's one classroom he could go into because he could hear the electric hum in the lights and he bothered him to violence. I mostly just taught him coping mechanisms, and begun honest about his feelings so he could tell when he needed to leave a situation. Oh, and i taught him poker. He liked the math behind the probability and i used exaggerated bluffing to teach him facial expressions.\n\nGreat kid. I'm excited to learn what he goes on to do."}]}
